- We lead development of computational, statistical, and ML/AI methods that leverage large-scale and multi-omic data to understand cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic responses.
- We are interested in disease systems of multi-cellular components.  
- We foster an interdisciplinary, inclusive, and supportive environment. We welcome computational biologists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists, MDs, immunologists, and oncologists. 
- We are enthuastic collaborators to work on real-world biological and translational genomics problems. 
- <u>Postdocs</u> or PhD soon-to-be who work on areas like computational biology, bioinformatics,  single-cell multi-omics, new spatial transcriptomics, deep learning models, genetic variant function, and biological questions in cancer or tumor microenvironment - Welcome to contact and join us! If possible please include (1) CV or Resume (2) A short research statement describing previous/ongoing work and proposed research and interest (3) 1-3 representative publications (published, accepted, or preprint) (4) Three names of references and contact information. 
- <u>Prospective students</u> interested in our research are encouraged to apply through Duke graduate programs: Computational Biology and Bioinformatics ([CBB] - PhD), Biostatsistics (PhD & MS), UPGG (PhD). Graduate admission decisions are made by program committee. MS students from Biostatistics, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, ECE etc. are welcome for research interns/assistantships. If contacting for interest, please include (1) CV or Resume and if available (2) Short description of research experience and interest (3) Three names of references. Thanks!
